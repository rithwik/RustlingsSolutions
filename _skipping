Make `shared_numbers` be an `Arc` from the numbers vector. Then, in order
to avoid creating a copy of `numbers`, you'll need to create `child_numbers`
inside the loop but still in the main thread.

`child_numbers` should be a clone of the Arc of the numbers instead of a
thread-local copy of the numbers."""
